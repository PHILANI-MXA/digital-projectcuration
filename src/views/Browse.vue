            The image shows a peaceful rural landscape in the Eastern Cape. In
            the foreground, a group of Nguni cattle with black, brown, and white
            patterns are grazing on the desert . Their large, curved horns stand
            out against the soft, early morning sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next to the cattle, there is a strong horse with a rider wearing
            traditional clothing, showing the connection between people and
            animals. In the distance, small thatched houses and gentle hills add
            to the feeling of life in the countryside. The warm, golden light of
            the sunrise gives the scene a calm and respectful atmosphere,
            highlighting the important roles of cattle and horses in this
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            This scene reflects how these animals are valued back then and in
            our daily lives, showing a bond between people and nature.

            A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use
            of the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases

            As you can see, the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated

            on but actually conveys no tangible information at all. It simply
            takes up space and should not really be read.

            The image shows a group of baby sheep, called lambs, staying close
            to their mothers in a green field. The lambs have soft, fluffy white
            coats, with a few dark spots here and there. They stand on small,
            wobbly legs, and some are jumping around or gently nudging their
            mothers. The lambs look happy and full of energy, adding a joyful
            feeling to the scene. Their mothers stay close, grazing and keeping
            an eye on them. This shows the strong bond between the mothers and
            their young. Soft morning light makes the lambs look warm and
            bright, showing their fluffy coats and small features. The wide,
            open field around them adds a calm feeling, showing the peaceful
            life of animals in the countryside. The image captures the gentle
            care that animals have for their young.
